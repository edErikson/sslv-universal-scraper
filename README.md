# SS.lv Web Scraper and Data Analysis

## Description

This project is a comprehensive toolset beginning with a web scraper built in Python that scrapes data from the SS.lv website, a popular classifieds site in Latvia. Post extraction, the data undergoes analysis and visualization to glean insights, particularly related to real estate listings.

Web Scraper
The scraper can fetch details from multiple categories of listings like computers, cars, furniture, real estate, etc. based on the URL provided. The scraped data is then saved in CSV format.

Data Analysis
The extracted real estate data is further analyzed using a Jupyter Notebook to understand trends and insights in the listings. Visualizations including maps are generated to better represent the data distribution across different districts.
## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- BeautifulSoup4
- requests

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edErikson/sslv-universal-scraper
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd sslv-webscraper
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
